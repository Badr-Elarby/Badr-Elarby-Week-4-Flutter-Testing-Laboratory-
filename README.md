ðŸ§ª Flutter Testing Laboratory

This project was part of a Flutter testing assignment focused on fixing broken widgets and implementing proper unit and widget tests.
The main goal was to identify issues in the provided widgets, refactor the code to follow clean and maintainable practices, and ensure that all functionalities were properly covered by tests.

ðŸ”§ What Was Done

Fixed logical and UI bugs in three main widgets:

Login Form Widget â€“ handled input validation and error states.

Profile Card Widget â€“ improved data rendering and null safety handling.

Weather Display Widget â€“ fixed temperature conversion, loading states, and added null checks.

Wrote unit tests to verify internal logic and utility functions.

Implemented widget tests to ensure correct UI rendering and widget interactions.

Applied Git workflow using feature branches for each widget fix.

Merged all feature branches into develop, and finally into the main branch.

ðŸ§± Example Work

Login Form Widget:

Fixed validation logic for email and password fields.

Ensured proper error messages are displayed for invalid input.

Added unit tests for validation functions and widget tests to verify form behavior.

Profile Card Widget:

Handled null and missing user data gracefully.

Improved layout and UI consistency.

Added widget tests to ensure correct rendering of name, email, and avatar.

Weather Display Widget:

Fixed temperature conversion logic (added missing +32 in Fahrenheit formula).

Added null safety for incomplete API responses and improved loading/error handling.

Wrote unit tests for temperature conversion and widget tests to verify proper data display.

ðŸ§  Lessons Learned

Strengthened understanding of unit, widget, and integration testing in Flutter.

Learned how to mock asynchronous functions and handle API-like responses in tests.

Practiced debugging UI behavior using the Flutter Test Framework.

Improved code quality by applying clean architecture principles and separating logic from UI.

Understood the importance of null safety, state management, and reproducible testing to maintain app stability.
